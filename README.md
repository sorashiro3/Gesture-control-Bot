# Gesture-Control Bot
Hello, Enthusiasts!

This project was created for Fun and out of personal interest.

I have developed a machine learning model to recognize real-time hand gestures using a camera. This model can be used to control a wireless bot with simple code.

Additionally, this project allows you to create your own dataset easily, enabling you to customize the hand recognition model for various tasks.

# Important
The main Python code is in the **"app.py"** file, while the model and dataset are stored in their respective directories.
You can run the code in **"capture"** mode to create a custom dataset, then make adjustments to expand its capabilities.

I utilized Google's Mediapipe framework for hand recognition and created a custom dataset, training my neural network to control the bot.
